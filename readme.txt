MinimalistFlex is an elegant, easy to use theme that aims to 
provide a smooth user experience.

== Description ==
MinimalistFlex is a well designed theme that provides as 
many options as possible while not being overwhelming.

MinimalistFlex supports all the features you love: flexible header 
images, multiple widget areas, custom layout & colors, and 
some exclusive features like setting default featured images.

including the latest version as well as older versions

== Frequently Asked Quesions ==

The theme provides a new section, called "Default Featured 
Images", located in the customizer, just below "Colors".

This new section provided some new controls, including some 
images from us in case you don't have any good images right 
now.

changed.

As a bonus, we have 4 pre-built color palettes for you.
