provide a smooth user experience.

## Description
MinimalistFlex is a well designed theme that provides as

MinimalistFlex supports all the features you love: flexible header 
images, multiple widget areas, custom layout & colors, and 
some exclusive features like setting default featured images.

## Frequently Asked Quesions

### How do I set default featured images?

The theme provides a new section, called "Default Featured 
Images", located in the customizer, just below "Colors".

This new section provided some new controls, including some 
images from us in case you don't have any good images right 
now.

### To what extent can I customize the colors?

Almost everything you see on your site can have its color 
changed.

As a bonus, we have 4 pre-built color palettes for you.
